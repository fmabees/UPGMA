# UPGMA

To use, use terminal/command prompt to enter the folder that this file was downloaded in.
Commands: cd/, ls/

I think you need python 3 installed. A google search is all thats needed.
Then once you're in the right folder, type "python3 UPGMA.py"
and then it should run

i also added this option to print it nicely. it uses matplotlib
you can find out how to download it on google. if u need help just let me know. we can do a zoom call :)

once you have approved that it works, i will begin adding comments on what each line/loop/function does.
if you want to know what the code does, i can add the comments while on a call, so i can take u thru a line by line commentary :)

just let me know!
i tested it with the hw problem. it looks good to me tho.
